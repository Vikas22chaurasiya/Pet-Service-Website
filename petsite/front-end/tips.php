    </head>

    
    
        <p class="bold">
            1. Prevent Jumping up Early
         </p>
         <p class="column">
        If you’ve adopted a puppy, this is the perfect time to start training them not to jump up. While it may be cute as a puppy, it’s usually not a desired behavior in adult dogs, so training in it now is important. The best way to do this is to not pay attention
        to your puppy until all four of their paws are on the ground. This will teach them that if they want your attention, they can’t jump up to get it.
    </p>

    
        <p class="bold">
            2. Socialize Early
        </p>
        <p class="column">
        Socialization is the process of making sure that your dog is used to a wide variety of places, people, and other dogs. The more experience your dog has around other people and other dogs as well as in new places, the more comfortable they will be as an
        adult. Dogs that aren’t well socialized as puppies can exhibit undesirable behaviors like aggression, excessive barking, and fear as adults.
        
        <p class="bold">
            3. Reward Successful House Training
        </p>
        <p class="column">
            House training is often the most important thing for new pet owners. They understandably don’t want their pets relieving themselves indoors. However, some techniques, such as scolding or rubbing the puppy’s nose in the mess after an accident aren’t productive.
            Instead, your puppy will just be confused or even scared. It’s much better to reward successes than it is to punish accidents. In fact, rewarding success, in general, is the best way to train your dog. Providing treats and praise rather than
            punishing failure will help your dog learn better and also be more comfortable with you.
        </p>

        <p class="bold">
            4. Don’t Use a Crate as Punishment
        </p>

        <p class="column">
            Crate training is an important part of training a dog. The crate can give your dog a safe space that is just theirs. Plus, it can also help you to house train your dog. Dogs usually won’t relieve themselves in the place where they sleep, so your puppy
            will get used to holding it in. However, you should avoid putting your dog in the crate as a punishment. Otherwise, your puppy will associate the crate with being bad and won’t feel safe and secure there. Punishment for failure, in general,
            is generally not recommended. Yelling can just confuse your dog rather than reinforce the good behavior you want.
        </p>


        <p class="bold">
            5. Train on a Schedule
        </p>
        <p class="column">
            Train your dog at the same time every day. This will help your dog feel more comfortable training because they’ll know what to expect. Having a schedule is also particularly helpful with house training. Having meals at a scheduled time every day and then
            taking your dog outside to relieve themselves right afterward is the best way to train your dog to go outside to use the bathroom.
        </p>


        <p class="bold">
            6. Train the Most Important Commands First
        </p>
        <p class="column">
            If you want to teach your dog commands, it’s vital to teach the most important ones first. The commands and tricks that your dog learns first will be the ones they’ll remember the best. In fact, these will be the actions they do if you’re training them
            in a new command and they don’t know what to do.
        </p>

    
        <p class="bold">
            7. Stay Consistent
        </p>
        <p class="column">
            It’s important to stick with the same established rules. If you don’t want your dog on the couch as an adult, don’t let the dog on the couch as a puppy. Your dog will just get confused if they get used to certain rules only to have them change later on.
            The same rule goes for commands. You should stay consistent with the words you use. That way, your dog can learn to associate specific words with the behavior that you want to see.
        </p>


        <p class="bold">
            8. Have Patience
        </p>
        <p class="column">
            One of the most important things you can do in training your dog is to be patient. They’re learning and that can take a while. Plus, some breeds learn faster than others. Your dog might get distracted or forget. Don’t get angry when they make a mistake.
            Instead, correct the behavior and then make sure to reward successes.

           Q1) what Kind of Human Foods Can Dogs Eat?
        </p>

        <p class="column">
            We all feed our dogs a little human food from time to time. When those puppy dog eyes are looking up at you at the table or while you’re cooking, it’s hard to resist. These kinds of scraps really aren’t the best treats for our dogs and should be limited.
            The fact of the matter is that there are a lot of additives and other ingredients in these foods that aren’t good for our canines. And, overeating certain human foods can lead to obesity in our dogs.

        
            On the other hand, a lot of owners have taken to feeding their furry companions homemade dog food. There are a number of reasons this can be a good option for your pet. If you are considering feeding your dog human food over traditional dog food, what
            foods does your dog need and what foods are unhealthy for him?
        </p>


        <p class="bold">
            Q2) What nutrition do dogs need?
        </p>
        <p class="column">
            Dogs are carnivorous, meaning the primary component of their diet should be meat. But they aren’t obligate carnivores—or only meat-eating. In the wild, dogs survive mainly off of prey animals and some seasonal vegetables. Wild dogs will also occasionally
            eat fruits. When you’re deciding on your dog’s diet, it should primarily revolve around these food items.
        </p>


        <p class="bold">
           Q3)  What human foods are healthy for dogs?

        </p>
        <p class="column">
            all meat should be cooked and bones should be removed to avoid any choking hazard. It’s also important to note that some dogs are lactose intolerant and won’t handle dairy very well
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>1.Chicken <br> 2.Turkey <br> 3.Pork <br> 4.Lean beef <br> 5.Fish—salmon and sardines are especially good for dogs <br> 6.Eggs—cooked <br> 7.Cheeses—cottage cheese and hard cheeses in moderation are safe <br> 8.Yogurt—in moderation is an acceptable snack
            <br>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="bold">
            FRUITS & VEGETABLES

            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="bold">
            GRAINS
        </p>
        <p class="column">
            Most dogs need some moderately-fermentable fibers in their diets. Foods that are high in fiber are not good for dogs with high energy requirements, and dogs who are young and growing
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>1.Corn <br> 2.Quinoa <br> 3.Oatmeal <br> 4.Rice <br> 5.Bread—small amounts of plain bread are ok on occasion <br>
            </ul>
        </p>
